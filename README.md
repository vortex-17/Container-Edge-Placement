This repository contains source code for MITACS Globalink 2021 Project - Container placement in Edge Computing

In this project, we are trying to solve the placement strategy for containers in edge nodes while keeping in mind the power consumption of edge nodes and resource consumption of edge nodes and containers.

Things to do:
1. Define upper limit variable
2. Create a large dataset and check the algorithms
3. Log the time taken by the algorithm.

Suggestions
1. Work on Novelty part (possibly increase metrics, make it more complex) (tweaK existing algorithms)
2. Check new algorithms for Bin Packing algorithms 
3. Check Simulators
