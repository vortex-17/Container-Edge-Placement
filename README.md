# Scalable Container Placement in Edge Computing
This repository contains source code for experimentation of MITACS Globalink 2021 Project - Container placement in Edge Computing
In this project, we are trying to solve the placement strategy for containers in edge nodes while keeping in mind the power consumption of edge nodes and resource consumption of edge nodes and containers.

## Abstract

Containers and Edge computing both play pivotal roles in technological development. They have become the backbone of application development. This paper proposes a novel strategy to place containers in Edge nodes. It is based on class-constrained BestFit algorithm, a bin packing algorithm. The novel algorithm mainly focuses on scalability and resource consumption of containers. The novel algorithm is then experimented and compared against other algorithms.


## Experimentation

The data used to simulate the experiment was randomly generated and stored in a CSV file. This data consists of both container resource requirements, class of the container as well as edge node resource capacity. The number of containers and edge numbers varied in the simulation.

The novel algorithm is compared with Bin Packing BestFit algorithm.

### The report has detailed explanation for the problem and its solution.
